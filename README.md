Neelix Task Manager for Jira is designed to significantly improve activities management and common experiences for the team.

Jira is easy to use out of the box. However, things get a little dicey once you introduce your own organisational context (custom fields, etc). Ease of use diminishes, just as it would for any other flexible framework. Extra thought, and often guesswork, regarding classification attributes becomes a significant burden over time.

Another common thread is a lack of “experience” glue between different capabilities – Something that really brings it all together.

The philosophy is that even most technically capable folks do not need to spend cycles on things that are meant to be simpler.
